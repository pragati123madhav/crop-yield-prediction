# crop-yield-prediction
This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict crop yield based on various factors such as weather conditions, soil properties, and agricultural practices. The model is trained using a dataset that includes historical crop yield data and related features. 

The model is evaluated using standard metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared. The evaluation results are used to fine-tune the model for better performance.
